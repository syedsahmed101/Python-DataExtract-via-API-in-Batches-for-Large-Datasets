# Python-DataExtract-via-API-in-Batches-for-Large-Datasets

This project illustrates a python example of querying a REST API using a GET request in batches of a certain size using an offset.

Many REST APIs support limiting of output by allowing client applications to specify an output size and an offset. This will be particularly useful in cases where the API output is significantly large to process in a single API call. To alleviate the resources in a computing environment or optimize a long-running API GET request, try leveraging a batch mechanism to read the entire output using the API GET method.
